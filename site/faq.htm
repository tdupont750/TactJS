            <p>
                TactJS is a micro-framework which provides mechanisms for writing object-oriented
                javscript. Additionally, features like namespacing, behaviors, and an intelligent
                bootloader reinforce a style of javascript development that yields readable, maintainable,
                and above all discoverable code.

            <h2 id="why">
                <span class="txt-red"><b>&raquo;</b></span> Why use TactJS?</h2>
            <hr class="bdr-gray" />
            <p>
                The features in TactJS give developers a way to use object-oriented practices
                in the way they create scripts, and at the same time reinforce a mental framework
                around writing javascript that produces highly cohesive, and very low coupled code.
                That means better script libraries with modular components which can be reused,
                combined, and extended to create flexible, maintainable, and discoverable systems.

            <hr class="bdr-gray" />
            <p>
                In our experience front-end javascript development is approached by most developers
                with a bit of distate. Javascript by nature does not lend itself to a particular
                style or methodology and so most systems, especially those developed and maintained
                by multiple developers tend to become cluttered and difficult to manage over a very
                short period of time. The more complex the UI, the more convoluted the scripts become
                and that tends to make developers even more reluctant to want to do things like
                test, refactor, or modify existing scripts. That means more scripts are created,
                and the clutter continues to pile up. One-off scripts, hacks, and kludges form a
                barrier to productivity, and eventually front-end development on a project becomes
                a thoroughly unenjoyable chore because of highly coupled, and incomplehensible code.
            </p>
            <h2 id="oo">
                <span class="txt-red"><b>&raquo;</b></span> Why Object-Oriented?</h2>
            <hr class="bdr-gray" />
            <p>
                The mantra of object-oriented development is high cohesion and low coupling. The
                idea that code should work in such a way that it doesn't depend on the specifics
                of it's implementation is why object-oriented development became so popular in the
                first place. Javascript is great because it doesn't tie a developer to a particular
                paradigm, and that flexibility means it's incredibly easy to write code that follows
                multiple patterns and practices in the same space. That gets to be a problem very
                quickly because too many developers treat javascript development without the consideration
                it requires to write really good scripts. By introducing a clean method for creating
                object-oriented systems to javascript that allows developers to more consistently
                achieve the goals of high cohesion and low coupling, projects become much easier
                to manage, test, and change even for developers who had nothing to do with the original
                implementation.

            <p>
                TactJS is a collection of (nearly) independent features which can be mixed and
                matched to suit the needs of your particular project, all running on the latest
                version of JQuery. Just reference the features you want to use, then take a look
                at the Features and API pages for examples and guides on how to write code with
                TactJS.

            <hr class="bdr-gray" />
            <p>
                TactJS's class.extend relies on ECMAScript 5's <a class="txt-white" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty"
                    target="_blank">object.defineProperty</a> method. This means that if you are
                using object inheritance you will be limited to only the latest browsers, otherwise
                Tact.Query will the support Internet Explorer 8.</p>
            <p>
                (Using class.extend) Internet Explorer 9 and greater.<br>
                (Not using class.extend) Internet Explorer 8 and greater.<br>
                Mozilla Firefox 3.5 and greater.<br>
                Google Chrome 5 and greater.</p>
