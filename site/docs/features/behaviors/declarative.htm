<h3>
    Features - Behaviors - Declarative Behaviors</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    Behaviors in TactJS are based on a declarative model. The idea is that binding
    your scripts to an element (or elements) on the page should be as up-front as possible
    in order to prevent confusion, duplication, and to provide a discovery path that
    you or another developer can use to easily see what scripts are running on a given
    piece of your document.
</p>
<p>
    There are a couple of very simple rules for implementing behaviors which we recommend
    you follow.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Keep individual behaviors in their own file which should be named the same as the
        behavior, minus the namespace.
        <div class="ind10">
            If you have a behavior with the fully qualified name of "Docs.Demos.Toggler" then
            it should be in "toggler.js" (case doesn't matter).</div>
    </li>
    <li>If you want to be able to use the bootloader to find and load behaviors asynchronously
        when they are needed, put your behavior js file in a folder structure inside your
        _scriptsRoot which matches its namespace.
        <div class="ind10">
            A behavior named "Docs.Demos.Toggler" should be located at "_scriptsRoot/Docs/Demos/toggler.js"
            (again, case doesn't matter).</div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In order to bind this behavior to an element you have two options: lazy and eager.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Lazy
        <div class="ind10">
            Lazy means that the script won't be loaded on the client until an action is performed
            against the element where that behavior is declared (like $.fn.msg(), or $.fn.broadcast),
            which gives you control over how scripts are loaded on the client. Most of the time,
            behavior script loads will be triggered by a user-initiated action like a button
            click or mouseover.</div>
    </li>
    <li>Eager
        <div class="ind10">
            Eager behaviors will be loaded as soon as the element is rendered in the DOM. These
            scripts will be loaded and thier init() methods called as soon as possible after
            the page is requested and will be available immidiately after page load.</div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Let's say you have a simple behavior called <strong>Docs.Demos.Toggler</strong>
    which is means to toggle a couple of classes on all the children in it's context...
</p>
<h3>
    Docs.Demos.Toggler</h3>
<pre>// Docs.Demos.Toggler :: Toggles visibility of first child elements
(function ($) {
    $.types.ns('Docs.Demos');
    Docs.Demos.Toggler = $.types.define(function () {
        var _context;
        var self = {
            init: function (context) {
                _context = context;
            },
            toggle: function () {
                $(_context).children().toggleClass("toggle-off toggle-on");
            }
        };
        return self;
    });
})(jQuery);</pre>
<p>
    If we wanted to make sure this behavior was available as soon as the page is rendered,
    we would declare it using the "eager" modifier like so.
</p>
<pre data-behaviors-eager="Docs.HTMLEncode">
<div data-behaviors-eager="Docs.Demos.Toggler">
</div>
</pre>
<p>
    If on the other hand, we wanted the behavior to be loaded and acted against at some
    time after the page is rendered, we would declare it using the "lazy" modifier.
</p>
<pre data-behaviors-eager="Docs.HTMLEncode">
<div data-behaviors-lazy="Docs.Demos.Toggler">
</div>
</pre>
<p>
    The declarative model doesn't stop there. Thanks to the HTML5 spec "data-" attribute,
    and the TactJS DOM Data module, we can also declare options which can be picked
    up by our behaviors and acted against. By using the messaging architecture implemented
    by TactJS behaviors, your user-initiated actions can be declared in the markup
    too!
</p>
