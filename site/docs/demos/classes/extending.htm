<h3>
    Demos - Objects & Inheritence - Extending an Object</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Extending objects in TactJS is very simple. Let's take a look at a simple Docs.Demos.Pet
    object...
</p>
<pre>
(function ($) { 
    // Define a namespace
    $.types.ns("Docs.Demos");
    // Define the Pet class.
    Docs.Demos.Pet = $.types.define(function(name) {
        // Private Members
        var _name = name
        var _walkCount = 0;

        // Public Members
	    var self = {
            walk: function(){
                _walkCount++;
                return  _name
                    + " has been walked "
                    + _walkCount
                    + " time(s) today.";
            }
        };
        return self;
    });
})(jQuery);
</pre>
<p>
    Now let's create a Docs.Demos.Dog object which will extend Docs.Demos.Pet and have
    it's own distinct method "speak()" which is not part of the Docs.Demos.Pet object.
</p>
<pre>
(function ($) { 
    // Define a namespace
    $.types.ns("Docs.Demos");
    // Define the Dog class.
    Docs.Demos.Dog = $.types.extend(Docs.Demos.Pet, function(name) {
        // Private Members
        var _speak = "Woof!";

        // Public Members
	    var self = {
            speak: function(){
                return name + " says " + _speak;
            }
        };
        return self;
    });
})(jQuery);
</pre>
<p>
    Notice the line, <b>"Docs.Demos.Dog = $.types.extend(Docs.Demos.Pet, function(name)
        {"</b> where we use $.types.extend and pass in the class we wish to extend as
    the first parameter. The extended class Docs.Demos.Pet will be accessed through
    the "self.superclass" keyword, but only its public methods will be available to
    Docs.Demos.Dog. The private members in the superclass are therefor more appropriately
    described as "internal" for the purposes of TactJS, and the only way to make these
    members accessible would be to add accessors to the "self" of Docs.Demos.Pet.
</p>
<p>
    Also note that "name" is part of the declaration of "Docs.Demos.Dog." In order for
    the extended class to function properly, it's constructor contract must be maintained.
    In this case, "name" will be passed to the constructor of the superclass of Docs.Demos.Dog
    and stored as a private member. It will be this private member that is called upon
    when the walk() command is invoked against Docs.Demos.Dog.
</p>
<p>
    Now let's declare a new Docs.Demos.Dog object that we can command to walk and speak...
</p>
<pre>
    // Instantiate a new Docs.Demos.Dog object
    var dog = new Docs.Demos.Dog("Taboo");

    // Invoke the speak and walk commands on dog
    dog.speak(); // Taboo says Woof!
    dog.walk(); // Taboo has been walked 1 time(s) today.
</pre>
<p>
    That's all there is to it!
</p>
<p>
    Now let's change Docs.Demos.Pet to provide an accessor to it's private "_name" member
    so we can use it from the Docs.Demos.Dog object, or directly since it will be in
    the object's public space.
</p>
<pre>
(function ($) { 
    (function ($) { 
    // Define a namespace
    $.types.ns("Docs.Demos");
    // Define the Pet class.
    Docs.Demos.Pet = $.types.define(function(name) {
        // Private Members
        var _name = name
        var _walkCount = 0;

        // Public Members
	    var self = {
            walk: function(){
                _walkCount++;
                return  _name
                    + " has been walked "
                    + _walkCount
                    + " time(s) today.";
            },
            name: function(){
                return _name;
            }
        };
        return self;
    });
})(jQuery);
</pre>
<p>
    Now we can change our Docs.Demos.Dog class to use the "name" accessor in its superclass...
</p>
<pre>
(function ($) { 
    // Define a namespace
    $.types.ns("Docs.Demos");
    // Define the Dog class.
    Docs.Demos.Dog = $.types.extend(Docs.Demos.Pet, function(name) {
        // Private Members
        var _speak = "Woof!";

        // Public Members
	    var self = {
            speak: function(){
                return self.superclass.name() + " says " + _speak;
            }
        };
        return self;
    });
})(jQuery);
</pre>
<p>
    Our output for the example above should remain the same, but now our pet's name
    is both stored and accessed from the same place in all cases.
</p>
<pre>
    // Instantiate a new Docs.Demos.Dog object
    var dog = new Docs.Demos.Dog("Taboo");

    // Invoke the speak and walk commands on dog
    dog.speak(); // Taboo says Woof!
    dog.walk(); // Taboo has been walked 1 time(s) today.
</pre>
