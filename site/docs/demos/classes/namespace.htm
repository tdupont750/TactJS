<h3>
   Demos - Objects & Inheritence - Namespacing</h3>
<hr>
<p>
    Namespaces in TactJS work about the way you'd expect them to. They allow you to
    create sections of related scripts and help organize your code-base. Thanks to the
    bootloader, fully qualified objects declared as behaviors can even be loaded asychronously
    when they're needed as long as the naming convention requirements in the file-system
    or script repository are met.
</p>
<h4>
    Defining a namespace</h4>
<p>
    Creating and using a new namespace is as simple as declaring it as in the following
    example:
</p>
<pre>// Define a namespace
$.types.ns("Docs.Demos");
</pre>
<p>
    Namespaces can be a single word, or multiple words separated by a '.' and they can
    be reused as often as you like so you can have many different classes under the
    same namespace.
</p>
<h4>
    Bootloader Conditions</h4>
<p>
    If you want to be able to load your classes or behaviors asynchronously via the
    bootloader, your project's script folder must follow a certain pattern. It's pretty
    simple: the namespace should correspond with a location in your scripts folder such
    that the <b>"Docs.Demos.Namespace.ClassName"</b> object is located in the file at <b>"_scriptsRoot/docs/demos/namespace/classname.js"</b>
</p>
<p>
    The bootloader defaults "_scriptsRoot" to "scripts/" but since it's a global variable, you can change it in the head of your document like so:
</p>
<pre>
    _scriptsRoot = "../scripts/";
</pre>
