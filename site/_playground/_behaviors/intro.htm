<h3>
    Behaviors in TactJS: An Introduction</h3>
<p>
    In order to work with behaviors in TactJS it is first important to define a few
    key terms.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Behavior</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A behavior is a TactJS class that is declared in a webpage's markup and works
                as a closure which can be reused. It is typically declared in it's own file.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Behavior Namespace</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Behaviors are intended to use a namespace that reflects the actual location of the
                class in the website's script directory. This is so that the $.bootloader can find
                the behavior required by simply looking at it's declaration in markup. It also aides
                developers in discovering which behaviors are interacting with a peice of markup
                quickly, and where to find those behaviors in the web project.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Message</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>In order to call a method in a behavior, a message can be sent targeting the element
                that behavior is declared on. Only the instance of the behavior on the targeted
                element will be affected.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Broadcast</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Broadcast is like message, except that it will target all the behaviors within the
                targeted element, sending the message to each of them.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Container/Context</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The element on which a behavior is declared. Behaviors are designed to only interact
                within their context so that the behavior can be reused with no interference</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Now let's look at a very basic behavior called <strong>Docs.Demos.Toggler</strong>
    which has one method to toggle the visibility of first children inside it's container.</p>
<h3>
    Docs.Demos.Toggler</h3>
<pre>// Docs.Demos.Toggler :: Toggles visibility of first child elements
(function ($) {
    $.types.ns('Docs');
    Docs.Demos.Toggler = $.types.define(function () {
        var _context;
        var _config;
        var self = {
            init: function (context) {
                _context = context;
                _config = $(_context).data();
                if (_config.behaviorsEager)
                    self.toggle();
            },
            toggle: function () {
                $(_context).children().toggleClass("toggle-off toggle-on");
            }
        };
        return self;
    });
})(jQuery);</pre>
<p>
    This simple behavior has all the major pieces of any behavior.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>$.types.ns("Name.Space")</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Since behaviors are inteded to be loaded on demand, it's important that their namespace
                be declared with each class declaration so it is always available. The namespace
                must correspond to the location in the filesystem where the behavior can be found.
                In this case, the behavior is at "<strong>Core/Docs/Toggler.js</strong>" inside
                the script directory.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>_context</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Used to store the context passed to the behavior instance when the behavior is parsed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>self</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The "public scope" for the behavior. Methods declared here can be invoked via message
                or broadcast. Typcally contains <strong>init</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>init</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>A special method in self invoked when the behavior is first initialized in the DOM.
                It is passed the behavior's context. Init is usually used to store the context and
                configuration data in a private scope variable and perform any required first load
                actions. If the element uses "data-behaviors-eager" then init will be run as soon
                as the element on which it is declared is added to the DOM.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are two ways to declare a behavior on an element.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>data-behaviors-lazy</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>This attribute name indicates that the behaviors on this element will only be loaded
                    once they are requested via a message or broadcast to the element. This also means
                    that if the behavior scripts are not already on the page, the bootloader will wait
                    until the element receives a message to load the required scripts. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>data-behaviors-eager</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Using this attribute tells the behaviors to load their required scripts through
                    the bootloader (if necessecary), and run their <strong>init</strong> methods as
                    soon as the element is added to the DOM.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Now let's see how to declare <strong>Docs.Demos.Toggler</strong> on an element with
    both <strong>data-behaviors-lazy</strong> and <strong>data-behaviors-eager</strong></p>
<pre>&lt;div class=&quot;square mas&quot; div data-behaviors-lazy=&quot;Docs.Demos.Toggler&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;bg-green square pointer toggle-off&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;bg-red square pointer toggle-on&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;                
            </pre>
<div class="square mas" data-behaviors-lazy="Docs.Demos.Toggler">
    <div class="bg-green square pointer toggle-off">
    </div>
    <div class="bg-red square pointer toggle-on">
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Which produces this red square. Because we used <strong>data-behaviors-lazy</strong>,
    nothing has changed from the original markup because the behavior has not yet been
    initialized.</p>
<p>
    Let's see what happens when we change the markup to use <strong>data-behaviors-eager</strong>...
</p>
<pre>&lt;div class=&quot;square mas&quot; data-behaviors-eager=&quot;Docs.Demos.Toggler&quot; &gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;bg-green square pointer toggle-off&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;bg-red square pointer toggle-on&quot; &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<div class="square mas" data-behaviors-eager="Docs.Demos.Toggler">
    <div class="bg-green square pointer toggle-off">
    </div>
    <div class="bg-red square pointer toggle-on">
    </div>
</div>
<p>
    Viola! The elements are toggled in the init method, and now we see a green square!
    Next let's look at <strong>message</strong> and <strong>broadcast</strong></p>
